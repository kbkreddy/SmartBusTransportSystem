# Project Abstract:
The proposed design attempts to answer the passengerâ€™s need for a reliable, accurate and
comprehensive system that provides them with useful information like dynamic and accurate bus
timings, number of available seats, number of buses travelling through a particular route, notifying
the user when the bus is at a nearby stop and bus live tracking. The product employs the means of
a GPS system, IR based passenger counter, a GSM module and an MSP Launch Pad (microcontroller)
to solve the perennial problems of the Indian bus travelers. The product potentially targets the
markets of Government and Private public transport with other modes like in-app advertisements,
and marketing of anonymous big data, to further monetize it. Thus, it can replace or add-on to
other mediums like Google Maps Transit to provide a more precise and all round information about
the buses.
